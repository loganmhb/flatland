World, I am Logan. This is my blog now.

Last spring I graduated from a liberal arts college with a degree in the humanities. Perhaps not coincidentally, just before I graduated I became intensely interested in programming, starting with Udacity's CS101 online course. From there I began immersing myself in blogs, books, languages and assorted other detritus of the programming world.

This might not just be a blog about programming, but my primary reason for writing it right now is to have a place to write about the projects I'm working on, my programming goals, questions and answers. I hope it will serve as motivation for me to finish projects that I start and think about things critically and well.

So what are my goals? What projects am I working on?

There are a few things on the burners. My long-term goal is to get a job in the software engineering industry, probably as a web developer. Short and medium term, I'd like to make some progress on and hopefully finish a few projects I've been stalling on for a while:

* [Vladimir](http://github.com/loganmhb/vladimir), a UCI chess engine I'm writing in Clojure
* a [web frontend](http://github.com/loganmhb/eatsafeweb) for the [EatSafe] public API for Chicago health inspection data
* working through Structures and Interpretations of Computer Programming (current progress: 2.39 -- not yet on Github)
* the Udacity frontend developer nanodegree (maybe - currently in a free trial)

We'll see how it goes.
